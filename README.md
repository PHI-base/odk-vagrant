# Ontology Development Kit Vagrant machine

This repository configures a Linux virtual machine wrapper for the [Ontology Development Kit](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit) (ODK), which allows the ODK to be used on operating systems that do not support Docker natively (for example, Windows 7 and older versions of Windows 10). The virtual machine is set up using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) as its virtualisation software. Ontology files can be imported into the virtual machine by using Vagrant synced folders.
